### Functional Description
This app allows students that have just make a booking for a room in a flat in Barcelona to get in contact with it's landlord as well as with the other students that will be hosted in the same flat. In the other side it automates the landlord's managemente processes (contracts drafting, charges and payments control)

After registering, the student checks in into a what we call *Jam* which is the group of students and the landlord of the appartment she/he will be hosted in. Instantly the student will be listed in the *Jammers* section together with the rest of the flatmates. The *Jam* structures itself in the following sections:
- Board: section where everybody in the Jam can post a message (public communication).
- Jammers: list of the flatmates + jam admin (landlord). By clicking in the profile of each *jammer* they can also communicate privately.
- Private Zone: summarizes all the information regarding his contract conditions.
